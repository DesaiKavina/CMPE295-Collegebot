That is why we set up the Table of Reflection Deadlines to correspond with Sparta Camp dates. All students must complete the Reflection by the date indicated in the Table of Reflection Deadlines. Completing work by the deadline ensures that you have the information you need to make a course selection. It also ensures that you will be cleared of the prerequisite for entry-level writing courses in the system.",
What happens if I don't complete the Reflection before Sparta Camp orientation?,"There are two consequences to not completing this work: You will not be prepared to produce your first SJSU writing portfolio during the first week of your writing course. You may not have the prerequisite you need to enroll. If you are trying to enroll in either English 1A or English 1AF, the computer will block your enrollment until you have the prerequisite done.",
What is an advisor and how do I find one,"Most students have three advisors: a major advisor, a minor advisor (if you're completing a minor), and a General Education advisor.  The list of major advisors is available outside HGH 112 and on the undergraduate advisors page.  You choose your advisor.  If possible, meet with the same advisor each time.",
What should I bring with me to the meeting with my major advisor?,"Bring your laptop, smartphone, or other device that allows you to access your transcripts and degree progress report on MySJSU. In addition, bring your list of questions.",
What courses do I need to take for the communication studies major?,"Core Courses: COMM 101C (pre/corequisite for COMM 198 and 199C), COMM 198, and COMM 199C. Foundations • Inquiry • Practice Courses: Two courses from each area. Additional Courses: 8 units of electives in Communication Studies (may be upper- or lower-division)",
What additional courses should I take in the major?,"The department offers a wide variety of courses.  Identify your own interests, needs, and learning objectives as a basis for choosing your 8 units of additional courses. Meet with your advisor to help you select courses that best fit your educational and professional goals. These courses may be lower- or upper-division. ",
What is a lower-division course? What is an upper-division course?,"Any course you've taken at a community college is a lower-division course. At SJSU, any course numbered below 100 is lower-division and any course numbered 100 and above is upper-division. Community colleges never offer upper-division courses.",
Can I count my community college communication courses toward the electives for the major?,"Yes, if it is a college-level course in communication studies, speech communication, or communication.  Consult with your advisor to determine if you can count a community college course toward your COMM major at SJSU.  You may count up to 8 units of lower division courses as additional courses toward your program of study.  You may not double count lower-division communication courses used to satisfy your Core GE requirements toward the major. ",
Can I count a course taken at another university or college as a core course for the major?,Bring a course description (copied from the catalog of the school you previously attended) and/or syllabus and documentation showing the course was transferred.  Your advisor will determine whether it is the equivalent of one of our courses.  Note that core courses in the major are upper-division; upper-division courses must transfer in from a four-year school and be considered upper-division or junior/senior level at that school.),
Is there a required minimum grade for a course to count toward the major?,"""D-"" is the lowest passing grade.  Sometimes, as with GE Basic Skills and SJSU Studies courses, you must earn a ""C-"" or better to meet the GE requirement, even though you pass the class with a lower grade.  You must have an overall 2.0 GPA and a 2.0 in the major to be eligible to graduate.",
How many CR/NC classes can I count toward the major?,No more than 6 units.,
What is double counting and can I do it?,"Double counting is when you use one course to count for both SJSU Studies and the major. You may double count up to 6 units of SJSU Studies courses (currently COMM 100W, 157/157SL, 168A/B, 174, 179) toward the major. You may not double count any Core GE (lower division) courses.",
What is a flag or hold and how do I get it removed?,"A flag is a registration hold put on your records.  The flag is placed on your records at the time of transfer.  You must meet with a major advisor before your second semester at the University.  At this meeting, your advisor will give you a form to turn in to the department office (HGH 108) to have your flag removed. Failure to meet with an advisor and remove the flag will prevent you from being able to register for classes in the next semester.",
Do I have to complete a minor?,"No, you do not need to complete a minor. For the minor, you work with an advisor in in a department outside of Communication Studies to determine the courses you need to take. If you complete a minor, you will have your advising and your forms approved in that department (not in Communication Studies). If a minor in another department requires fewer than 18 units (e.g., Business requires 15 units), make sure you meet the 120 units total for the University baccalaureate requirements. ",
How do I find out what I need to do for my GE requirements?,"There are two kinds of General Education requirements: Basic Skills (lower division, often taken at a community college, also called Core GE) and SJSU Studies (also called Advanced GE or upper-division GE). ",

How do I begin my application?,Please follow the MS Software Engineering application submission process. This web page will answer many of your questions about submitting an application. You should also review the information provided by Graduate Admissions and Program,https://www.sjsu.edu/msse/admissions/index.html
What are the application deadlines?,University admission deadlines are listed at,http://www.sjsu.edu/gape/prospective_students/deadlines/
Do you accept late applications?,At this time we do NOT accept late applications.,
What is the Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluation (GAPE) office?,"Applications are evaluated in a two-step process, first by the GAPE office then the department. The GAPE office administers all graduate admissions. It checks that your applications fulfill the minimum university criteria for admission. It checks your transcripts, degree certificates, TOEFL scores, visa status, and financial information. Currently, GAPE requires an evaluation of your transcripts by World Education Services (WES). Visit the GAPE web site for more information about WES evaluation for SJSU applications. ",
I have questions about providing documents (such as transcripts and degree certificates) and test scores (such as TOEFL and GRE scores). Whom do I contact?,"Documents and test scores should be submitted directly to GAPE. Please see the GAPE web site more information. Please do NOT contact a Computer Engineering department advisor or staff member for help with document submission as they will not be able to help you. If you have issues or questions about submitting documents, please contact GAPE and not the MS Software Engineering Advisor.",
I have questions about the MS Software Engineering program. Whom do I contact?,"Visit http://cmpe.sjsu.edu/content/office-hours and look for the MSSE Advisor. The times and location for advising sessions will be listed. The advising sessions are walk-in, group sessions for current, newly admitted, and prospective students. You do NOT need an appointment. Attending an advising session as a prospective student will allow you to hear from current graduate students as well have questions answered by an advisor. ",
What are the application fees?,"Please check with the application web site, Cal State Apply (http://calstate.edu/apply), for university fees.",
Do I need to submit letters of recommendation with my application?,Letters of Recommendation should NOT be submitted unless requested by the MS Software Engineering graduate advisor.,
"I need to know NOW whether you will accept me later, so that I can decide whether to work on undergraduate prerequisites, or whether I should try applying at a different university.","Unfortunately, we cannot give you a guarantee now that we will admit you later.",
I fulfill all requirements for admission. Am I guaranteed to be accepted?,"Unfortunately, no. When there are more qualified applicants than we have space available in the program, we offer admission to those whom we consider the most promising applicants, until all space is filled. ",
What is an ABET accredited program?,"ABET is the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. It is the official accreditation board for Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science programs in the United States. You will find a list of accredited universities at the ABET web site.",
"I do not have an Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Computer Engineering undergraduate degree but I do have an Engineering or Science degree. Can I be admitted conditionally classified?","Possibly, but you will be assigned prerequisite courses. The prerequisite courses you will be assigned are: CMPE 050 or CS 49J; CMPE 126 or CS 46B; CMPE 138; and CMPE 142.  You can choose to either take these courses or take a subject test. If you take the courses, you must achieve a B grade or better.  The equivalent of the first two prerequisites can be taken at a community college that provides courses that are listed (articulated) in http://artic.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/artic/all-course-to-course.html. If you take the classes in the Computer Engineering department, the conditions can be cleared with three courses specifically designed for graduate students.  See https://cmpe.sjsu.edu/content/test-new-ms-students for more detail.",
Do I need to demonstrate English proficiency,"If you do not have a degree from a US university, you need to provide a minimum TOEFL score of 550 paper based, 213 computer based, or 80 Internet based. As an alternative, you can submit IELTS scores with a minimum of 7.0. This is a University requirement. Students that submit TOEFL scores lower than the minimum will be denied admission by GAPE and will not be considered for conditional admission. Living or working in the US is NOT a basis for waiving the TOEFL test. ",
Do I need to provide GRE scores to be accepted?,"If you are a graduate of an ABET accredited program at a US university, you do not need to provide GRE scores. If you are not from an ABET accredited program and do not provide GRE scores, your application will be considered after all applications that provide these scores. There is a strong possibility that you will NOT be admitted. We use GRE scores to compare and rank candidates. In general, applications with GRE scores of Q+V < 294 or AW < 3.0 are denied. If you have at least five years of relevant software development professional experience, the GRE requirement can be waived.",
What is the status of my application?,The status of your application can be found on my.sjsu.edu. Please do not contact a Computer Engineering department advisor or staff person to ask the status of your application.,
Did you recently change the admission requirements?,Admission to the MSSE program is a competitive process. We continually monitor the number of applicants and the number of spaces in the program. We periodically revise our guidelines to give students accurate guidance for submitting successful applications.,
What are my chances of being admitted?,"Please note that I cannot predict your ""chances"" of being admitted to the program. However, you may find the following guidelines helpful. We are looking for students with a degrees in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Software Engineering. Degrees from an ABET accredited program is an admission plus. Applicants with degrees in other Engineering or Science disciplines are also considered. It is a plus for applicants to have professional experience in the software field. If you meet these criteria, we encourage you to apply.",
"I took certification courses in (such as for CISCO, Novell, Unix, or NT) system administration. Can I use them instead of college courses as course equivalencies?",No.,
I took professional development classes (such as UC Extension). Can I use them instead of college courses as course equivalencies?,No.,
"What is a typical set of computer science, computer engineering, or software engineering courses that you might expect of an applicant?","Here are some typical courses. This is not a complete list, but it should give you a flavor of the kind of courses that are typically a part of a BSSE, BSCmpE, or BSCS degree. 
Data Structures, Java Programming, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks ,Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, Computability Theory, Computer Graphics, Graphical User Interface Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Compiler Design, Analysis of Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Parallel Processing, Information Theory, Coding Theory, Cryptography and Computer Security, OO Analysis and Design",
I have already taken some graduate level computer related courses at another institution. Can I transfer them into the SJSU MSSE program once I am admitted?,See this page,https://www.sjsu.edu/msse/faq/applying/credit-transfer/index.html
I already took some graduate courses at SJSU before I was admitted to the MSSE program. Can those courses count towards graduation? ,"Yes, but there are restrictions: 
You can transfer at most 9 units (3 courses). At least 21 units (7 courses) must be taken after admission to the MSSE program.
These courses must not have counted towards any prior degree (""no double dipping"")
The courses must be less than 7 years old.",
I concluded that I need to take quite a few courses to prepare myself for admission to the MSSE program. Can I be conditionally admitted and take the courses as an MSSE student?,We may admit students on a conditional basis if the number of fully qualified applicants is less than the available space in the MSSE program. ,
I will be completing my undergraduate degree in the same semester in which I submit an application. Is that ok?,"For students in the US, yes. Be sure to clearly indicate that you expect to earn your BS in the current semester. Completing the degree will be a condition for admission. For international students, the GAPE office wants to see a degree certificate, so you will need to complete your undergraduate degree before you apply. Note that the date that the degree is conferred must be before the first day of classes in the graduate program. Note that for Indian students, the MS Software Engineering program has an expedited admissions process, and can evaluate an application for admission (and the necessary I-20) as soon as the 7th semester mark-sheet is available.",
 I do not have a 4-year Bachelor degree. Can I be admitted to the MSSE program?,A 4-year Bachelor degree is a minimum requirement for admission to the graduate school. Note that two degrees in the same subject area can be used to meet the minimum degree requirement. For example an applicant from India can use a three-year bachelors degree plus a masters degree to meet the requirement. The degrees must have been completed.,
I don't have a four-year degree or my undergraduate degree is not in Engineering or the Sciences. What can I do to become eligble to application to the the MS Software Engineering program?,"If you do not meet the minimum degree requirements, you should consider a Second Baccalaureate (aka, Post Bac) degree in Software Engineering. Unfortunately, SJSU does not currently admit students pursuing a Second Baccalaureate degree at this time. You may find the equivalent at other universities.",
"The California State University policy states that in unusual cases, the department may make exceptions to the 4-year Bachelor degree requirement. Does your department make these exceptions?",Very rarely. We may make an exception if you can demonstrate a strong background in a computer related field.,
"My application was rejected, but I disagree. Can I appeal?","GAPE does provide an appeal process. However, if you were denied admission due to lack of space, your application rejection is not appealable.",
My application was rejected. Can I find out why?,"No. We rank applications, and pick the highest ranking ones. For privacy reasons, it is not possible for you to compare your application against others.",
My application was rejected. Can I join the program on a part-time or conditional basis?,"No. There is no separate part-time program. If we had been able to accept you on a conditional basis, then we would have done so. If your application was rejected, your only recourse is to reapply.",
My application was rejected by the GAPE office. Can you intervene on my behalf?,"No. The GAPE office determines whether you fulfill the minimum entrance requirements to join a graduate program at San Jose State University. If the GAPE office determines that you did not meet those requirements, or that you did not submit required documents in a timely manner, the computer engineering department cannot intervene.",
"My application for a previous semester was rejected, but I would like to be reconsidered for the next semester. Can I submit additional materials without reapplying?","No. Your previous application is no longer active. You need to reapply by submitting a new application via Cal State Apply (http://calstate.edu/apply). The GAPE office retains documents from prior applications for one year. If you submit a new application within one year, you probably will not need to submit documents again. Check with the GAPE office to see if your old materials are still available.",
"My application was rejected, and I would like to reapply. What can I do to improve my chances?","Here are some suggestions:
Improve your GRE test scores.
Complete an undergraduate computer-related degree such as Software Engineering.
Submit letters of recommendation that show exceptional promise
Submit other evidence of exceptional promise such as publications, open-source software contributions, patents, etc.",
"I have an undergraduate degree but it did not provide the programming, math, science, or engineering skills I need for the MS Software Engineering program. What are my options?","Unfortunately, your options are limited. SJSU no longer admits students for Second Bachelors (AKA, post bac) degrees. Your best option is to acquire the skills you need at another university. Being admitted conditionally classified to the MS Software Engineering program is not an option.",
What are the application deadlines?,Vist this link,http://www.sjsu.edu/graduateadmissions/deadlines/
What is the application procedure?,Online application information may be obtained from http://www.sjsu.edu/graduateadmissions/want-to-apply/,
Where do I submit my application?,"Applications are submitted using the graduate admissions selection at Cal State Apply (https://www2.calstate.edu/apply/graduate). Applicants should select Engineering-Computer Engineering (MS) as the Major/Program Objective. GRE and TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE test scores should be routed to San José State University, code=4687. No department code is required. Do not choose Computer Science or Software Engineering if your interest is in Computer Engineering; the Computer Science Department is a separate department in the College of Science, and Software Engineering is a separate master’s program within the Department of Computer Engineering. For more information, see http://www.sjsu.edu/graduateadmissions/",
Does the Computer Engineering Department offer graduate assistantships to incoming or current students?,"Graduate teaching, research, and instructional student assistantships are competitive and are awarded based on the student's qualifications and fit to particular tasks. We do not award assistantships at the time of admission.",
I was admitted this semester. Is it possible for me to start my study next semester?,"New graduate students must take at least one course during the first semester at SJSU. Otherwise, admission is forfeited, and application to SJSU must be repeated. Thus the CSU does not allow admission deferrals at all. Check with the GAPE office whether to resubmit admission documents.",
"Upon being admitted to the program, am I required to make an appointment with the Graduate Advisor?",It is not necessary. Read carefully the acceptance email sent to you (email the Graduate Advisor if you haven’t received it or need a new copy) and this webpage. Attending the MS-CMPE new graduate student orientation session is required. It is not required but highly advisable to attend the university-wide SJSU Graduate Student Orientation presented by the Office of Graduate Studies.,
Can one of my admission conditions be waived if I have taken a course in the same subject in another institution?,No admission conditions can be waived. You must pass the subject test or its corresponding condition class in order to satisfy each admission condition.,
I have to satisfy one or more admission condition classes. How do they affect my GPA?,"All upper-division (100-level) and master’s level (200-level) letter-graded courses count towards the cumulative (or overall) SJSU GPA, even if they do not count towards the minimal requirements for the MS degree (i.e., courses listed on the candidacy form). However, CMPE 180s are credit/no credit (CR/NC) courses, and therefore the grades in those courses do not count toward GPA",
"After completing all my admission conditions, do I have to change my status from “conditional” to “classified” immediately?","No, your status will be changed when you file a Departmental Request for Candidacy and Graduate Degree Program Form (containing the university form called the Petition for Advancement to Graduate Candidacy), which you will do as part of the course activities in CMPE 295A or CMPE 299A. At that time, you will submit your SJSU graduate transcripts, admission letter listing admission conditions (if conditionally accepted), evidence of completing conditions (aforementioned transcripts and emails from department indicating passage of conditional course waiver tests), My Course History, transfer course permissions (if any), permissions to take courses in other departments (if any), and any other documentation needed to evaluate the accuracy of your submitted candidacy form.",
How can I register for classes?,"Go to your MySJSU account to register, but pay attention to fee payment deadlines. Because graduate students cannot enroll in undergraduate courses online and in advance of the semester, you will have to request a permission number from the department website(https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSficRs3aK7I4vD6y8IeMQS46a2Kne1cEY91xRScz_pSXRxniw/viewform) in advance (usually a day or two before the start of the semester) and then go to the first class meeting of the semester. To add a graduate class also requires a permission number.",
Whom do I contact with registration problems?,"If you cannot gain access to the system, please contact  cmshelp@sjsu.edu. If you have problems seeing the correct screen or problems with incorrect IDs, please contact  erecords@sjsu.edu.",
Do I need advising before enrolling in a class?,"If you follow the guidelines described in Section 7, an advising appointment is not necessary.",
"If I am the first one on the wait list for a full class, will I be given priority to be added to the class by the instructor?","After the semester begins, a class might have some available seats to add more students. The instructor will consider several factors to decide the priority order for adding students. He or she will decide whether the “wait list sequence” is one of the factors but is under no obligation to count it.",
"I tried to enroll in a class, but the enrollment (registration) system required departmental consent. How can I receive consent?","Consent in this case means acquiring a permission number. For some classes, such as project and GWAR classes, restrictions are put into place to ensure adequate preparation before enrolling. In addition, the department needs to be certain that those seeking enrollment are in our own master’s programs, have satisfied the necessary prerequisites, and have the academic standing required. Follow the instructions in Section 7.5 to obtain a permission number.",
"Once the Add Deadline has passed, how can I get a permission number (i.e., add code) for a class?","Again, follow the instructions in Section 7.5, which instruct you to attend the first class meeting of the semester and ask the instructor for a permission number. If you do not manage to obtain a PN and the Add Deadline passes, you will have to fill out a late add form (available in this case from the Registrar’s Forms’ website). Late adds must be approved by our department chair, but she routinely does approve them. There is no penalty or fee for a late add. The biggest problem with them is that you have probably missed a portion of the semester in the class.",
The time overlap of two courses prevents me from enrolling into either one. What shall I do?,"With a significant overlap, you can enroll in only one of them. The Graduate Advisor is not assigned to schedule the classes of the department. If the Department Chair determines that a new section is needed and can locate the proper personnel to offer the class, the additional class section will be posted on the schedule section within MySJSU. If the overlap is less than 15 minutes, you might be able to enroll in both classes by filing a course overlap form and submitting it to the department office.",
How late can I add or drop a class without penalty?,Courses may be dropped without penalty during the first fourteen days of the semester and added for the first 21 days. See the Calendar section of the university website www.sjsu.edu/provost/academic_affairs/resources/academic_calendars/ for exact dates and deadlines. Courses dropped during this initial period will not appear on the student's transcript.,
"If I drop a class now, can I enroll in it next semester?","Yes, you can enroll in the class by the same process as used this semester.",
I enrolled in both CMPE 180D and CMPE 200 or 240 but then failed the Digital Design and Microprocessor test. Will I be penalized if I drop CMPE 200 or 240 after the semester begins?,"This is a less frequent problem now that we generally accept new students only with the equivalent of CMPE 180D in their bachelor’s work and, therefore, they do not have the CMPE 180D condition.  But should this happen, CMPE 180D should be taken, but CMPE 200 and 240 cannot be taken. The same is true of CMPE 180A and C as prerequisites for CMPE 220.  Courses may be added or dropped without penalty before the Add Deadline and Drop Deadline, respectively, so it is imperative that the core class be dropped via MySJSU before the deadline if the challenge exam is not passed. A student with admission conditions can enroll in graduate classes and also CMPE 180A, C, and D in the first semester in the master’s program. However, drop a condition course immediately after receiving a passing result in the pertinent challenge exam. For refund and pro-rata charges that will occur after the Drop Deadline, refer to http://www.sjsu.edu/bursar/payment_refunds/.",
When should I establish or update my Plan (Program) of Study?,"It is not required to file a Plan of Study until applying for a CPT, filing a candidacy form, or being on probation. It is, however, helpful when seeking advising from the department or Graduate Advisor.",
Can I transfer undergraduate units received at SJSU?,"ou can transfer a graduate course taken when you were a SJSU undergraduate senior student, but there are several restrictions. The course must not be listed on your undergraduate major form and thus must not have been used to satisfy any requirements for the bachelor’s degree.",
Can I transfer graduate credits from extension or Open University courses of other universities?,No,
Can I transfer graduate credits from non-U.S. institutions?,No,
"Will a transfer course be counted as a core, specialization, or elective course?",It could be counted in place of any to which it is equivalent.,
When can I request a transfer of courses?,"After a semester begins, you can submit a Transfer Non-SJSU or Open University Course Request Form for each course you’d like to transfer. You must submit the request form with all supporting documents to the department office. The documents required include a syllabus from the course taken and an unofficial or official transcript showing the date taken, number of units/credits, and the grade earned. Minima of a “B” grade and 3 semester units/credits (or their equivalent) are required, and the course must have been taken recently enough that it will not expire by the seven-year limit at the point of graduating from the MS-CMPE program. The MS-CMPE Graduate Advisor will consult with the professors possessing the subject knowledge to decide whether to approve the request or not.",
Can I take off-campus courses as part of my degree program?,Off-campus courses cannot be used for the on-campus MS-CMPE degree program.,
I am working in the Silicon Valley. Is it feasible for me to attend classes?,Almost all single-section CMPE graduate courses are offered after 6:00 p.m.,
What are the differences between a master’s project and master’s thesis?,"A thesis has more rigid requirements for content and reporting style. A project in CMPE is a group affair over the course of two semesters. A thesis, a more in-depth and lengthy document, is an individual affair and often involves an additional semester or two of research, so it is advisable to start the research in the second semester after matriculation (or even the first). The submission date to the Office of Graduate Studies, which must approve theses but not projects, is relatively early in the semester, meaning half of the semester is lost in the thesis-preparation process. A project-track student must enroll in CMPE 295A and CMPE 295B in two consecutive semesters; a thesis-track student must enroll in CMPE 299A and CMPE 299B in two consecutive semesters. Summer enrollments are optional and depend on agreements with and availability of the supervising faculty member and other members of the research group.",
How can I find a project or thesis advisor and decide on my project or thesis topic?,"Your project/thesis topic must be closely related to your specialization. Your thesis or project advisor must be an SJSU Computer Engineering professor with expertise in the area of your specialization. To have a faculty member serve as your project or thesis supervisor, you must approach professors to inquire about joining their research team.",
Will the classes I take to satisfy my admission conditions be counted as part of the required 9 units for students on an F-1 visa?,Yes,
Will CMPE 298i for CPTs be counted as part of the required 9 units for students on an F-1 visa?,Yes,
Are there any requirements for taking CMPE 294?,The only requirement for taking CMPE 294 is to be a registered Computer Engineering Department graduate student.,
"If I take CMPE 294 and CMPE 295A concurrently, what is the consequence if I fail CMPE 294?","The completion of GWAR (e.g., receiving a passing grade in CMPE 294 or ENGR  200W) is required to obtain a passing grade in CMPE 295A or CMPE 299A. At the end of the semester, a student who has not completed GWAR will receive a failing CMPE 295A or CMPE 299A grade and must enroll in CMPE 295A or CMPE 299A again, restarting the project or thesis.",
"If I cannot complete CMPE 295B or CMPE 299B this semester, what should I do?","A student who is unable to complete CMPE 295B or CMPE 299B due to unforeseen circumstances beyond his or her control will be given a grade of “I” (Incomplete) or “RP” (Report in Progress) and will need to register for CMPE or UNVS 1290R for a one-semester extension. Please see the Graduate Advisor to arrange for a registration appointment for CMPE or UNVS 1290R, as it will not automatically be available on MySJSU. Documentation of the extenuating circumstance is needed to be given this privilege. A student who fails to complete the requirements of CMPE 295A or 299B without adequate documentation of circumstances beyond his or her control will have to repeat the class in a subsequent semester.",
"I’ve heard that the program is being changed to 33 units.  When will that happen, and what are the consequences for new and existing students?","The conversion of the MS-CMPE (and MSSE) program to 33 units will occur with the start of the Fall 2020 semester. Those who entered the program before that time will not be affected at all; their degrees will still require 30 units plus satisfaction of the GWAR. New master’s students will also be required to take 30 units plus GWAR, but if they secure a waiver for GWAR, they will have to choose an elective to take to make up the units. If a waiver is obtained by existing students, the GWAR class is not taken and the units do not need to be made up, so no elective class would be required in place of the GWAR class. Unless a GWAR waiver is involved, there is no difference between the two master’s programs.",
I was admitted into a different department but want to transfer into the MS-CMPE program. Can I do that?,The MS-CMPE program no longer takes transfers from other departments.,
I'm entering as a freshman.  What do I do?,"1. Make sure to attend frosh orientation, as described in the material sent to you by the university upon your acceptance.
2. Strongly consider enrolling for Science 2 in your first semester. 
3. At the beginning of the semester, meet with the College of Science Advising Center (COSAC) advisor, as described on the CS department advising web site.
4. If you are considering Calculus I in your first semester, be sure that you are registered to take the Calculus Placement Exam (or are exempt from it). 
5. Become familiar with the Schedule of Classes, the university catalog, and the blue sheet and sample program.
6. Also see the answer to the question about the computing devices you will need as an SJSU CS major.",
 Does the department participate in the Four-Year Graduation Pledge Program?,"Yes, although the conditions for BSCS students are very strict due to the large number of required courses in the program. In addition to all university requirements, you must get grades of C- or better in all courses, not repeat any courses, be ready to start calculus in your first semester, and stick with the sample program publicized by the department unless your advisor has approved a deviation. ",
What is Science 2?  What is Science 90T?,"Science 2 (Sci 002) is a course designed to improve retention rates in science and engineering and poor student preparation in general.  Effective Fall 2007, it is a permitted General Education course under Area E. It is an appropriate course for a substantial proportion of frosh CS majors.  Since the course is a General Education course, you can count it toward graduation (if you have not already taken another Area E course).",
Does the first computer science course (CS 46A) assume any background in computing?,"Officially, no. However, a number of students in the past have attempted to take the course with little experience with computing. Many of these students have not succeeded.",
What is the STAR Act?  What is SB 1440?  What is C-ID?  What is an AS-T degree?,"SB 1440, the STAR act, is a California law designed to improve the interface between community college programs and CSU degree programs. C-ID is a course numbering system used in the implementation of this act. Students with an appropriate AS degree (an ""AS degree for transfer"", or ""AS-T degree"", in computer science) are automatically exempt from certain BSCS requirements.",
I'm considering entering as a transfer student.  What do I do?,"For general information about transferring to SJSU, see the university web pages on Transfer Admission Requirements and SJSU Undergraduate Degrees and Impaction.  Pay special attention to the section on transferring as a lower-division student if this is relevant to you, since this kind of transfers may not be possible in a given semester.  Impaction is important since it is likely to result in a minimum GPA requirement for transfer, which you can check by clicking on the impaction link.",http://info.sjsu.edu/static/admission/undergrad-admission.html
"Can lower-division courses I have taken at other institutions count toward the BSCS degree?  If so, will they be recorded on MySJSU?","In most cases, lower-division courses that are substantially similar to Math or CS courses at SJSU can be used to satisfy major requirements.  In particular, students with an Associate Degree for Transfer in CS are guaranteed BSCS credit for Math 30, 31, and 42; Phys 50 and 51; and CS 46A, 46B, and 47.",
Can I use courses taken elsewhere to satisfy upper-division BSCS requirements at SJSU?,"1.Upper-division courses that were taken before entering the CS major, and that closely match SJSU courses allowable for that major, may be used to waive the corresponding SJSU BSCS requirements.
2. A lower division linear algebra course is likely to be accepted for waiver of the Math 129A requirement. A combined course in linear algebra and differential equations of at least 5 semester units is likely to be accepted for waiver of the Math 129A requirement.
3. For current CS majors, waiver of upper-division courses by coursework taken elsewhere while a student is a CS major at SJSU must be approved IN ADVANCE by the department.  This includes courses taken at SJSU outside the CS department.  Check with the CS department office (MH 208) for particulars.
4. In rare cases, a lower-division course taken at a topnotch institution before a student enters the CS major at SJSU may be used to waive an upper-division BSCS requirement at SJSU.",
How can I change my major to computer science?,"Entry into the CS major at SJSU is now competitive.  The rules for applying to change your major to computer science are given on the CS department's web site.  They apply to students seeking a double major and students returning who were not in good standing in the major or the university when they left, as well as to students seeking to change their only major.",https://www.sjsu.edu/cs/practicalities/major-change/
How do I go about getting a minor in computer science?  ,"You must meet the following requirements before you can declare a CS minor
- SJSU Cumulative GPA of 2.7 or better.
- Complete the following courses with a B- or better:
     A. Math 42.
     B. CS 46A (or equivalent course in Java).",
What is SJSU Studies?,"SJSU Studies is the advanced portion of General Education.  It consists of four requirements -- one course each from Areas R, S, V, and Z. Two requirements are met by BSCS Support Courses -- the Area Z requirement is met by CS 100W  (Technical Writing Workshop) and the Area V requirement is met by Phil 134 (Computers, Ethics, and Society).",
I don't understand the BSCS science requirements,"For the requirements in effect for Fall 2014 or later, 14 units of science coursework must be taken from a specified list, including 5 units from a sublist of this list.  If you don't count any of these 5 units toward GE, then you may satisfy the remaining 9 units with GE Areas B1/B3, B2, and R. ",
How do I know whether I have satisfied the language prerequisite for CS 46B (or 49J or 146 or 151)?,"If you took CS 46A at SJSU, you have satisfied the language prerequisite for CS 46B.  If you took CS 46B at SJSU, you have satisfied the language prerequisite for both CS 146 and 151.  If you took CS 49J at SJSU, you have satisfied the language prerequisite for both CS 146 and CS 151.  If you took CS 46A at SJSU, you should not take CS 49J.",
Does the department offer short courses on current computing topics?  Is that what CS 85 and CS 185 are?,"In a sense, yes. Sections of these two courses vary in their content vary from 1 to 3 units. One-unit sections (numbered CS 85A or CS 185A) will be graded credit/no credit. Two-unit sections (numbered CS 85B or CS 185B) and three-unit sections (numbered CS 85C or CS 185C) will use letter grades.
Most CS 85 and CS 185 courses will count as CS electives.  Normally only one BSCS elective may be satisfied in this way.  However courses such as Mobile Device Development that have become permanent courses under a different number are not subject to this limitation.",
"What is a ""deep"" course?  If I chose a ""B"" course for the deep course but have changed my mind, how can I complete my graduation requirements?  What if I already took the corresponding ""A"" course?","A ""deep course"" is just one that can be used as the last required computer science course in the BSCS requirements.  For Fall 2015 the deep courses are CS 116B, 123B, 153, 157B, 158B, 161, 167B, and 167C.
You can change your mind about what deep course to take just as you can change your mind about an elective.  How you do this will depend in part on whether you have taken another ""A"" course, whether you have room in your electives to take another ""A"" course, and whether you are willing to take another ""A"" course even though you have completed your electives.",
Can I make substitutions for courses in the BSCS program?,"In some cases, yes, with approval from an advisor (subject to approval by the department's undergraduate coordinator).",
When and how can I drop classes?  When and how can I add classes?,"University policy S09-7 states that for a student to drop after the first two weeks, there must be serious and compelling reasons.  In the last 20% of the semester, exceptions are granted only if these serious and compelling reasons are beyond your control.",
"Is there a way of retaking a course to improve my grade?  If so, how does it work?","SJSU has a provision for ""grade forgiveness"", allowing undergraduate students to retake an undergraduate course to improve their grade in the course.  Constraints on the use of grade forgiveness can be found in the university catalog.",
I think I already know the material in a particular course.  Can I get credit by examination?,"The department currently allows credit by examination only for CS 46A, and only by taking the Computer Science AP Exam, as required by the new university policy for credit by examination.",
Can I use courses taken in the College of Engineering to satisfy BSCS requirements?,"In many cases, yes, if you took the course while you were an engineering major.  For example, Engr 100W may be used to replace CS 100W if you took the former course while an engineering major. However note that when it comes to SJSU Studies, BSCS students may count Engr 100W toward Area Z only, and not toward Area R.",
Does the department offer credit for extension courses taken elsewhere?  For work experience?,"Since extension courses vary so widely and offerings change so frequently, it is not possible for us to evaluate the vast number of extension and online courses being offered. Therefore, it is our policy not to accept extension courses as equivalent to SJSU courses, unless the course is accepted in a university's CS degree program.",
Does the department offer any certificate programs?,"The department now offers a Basic Certificate in Cyber Security Fundamentals.  All of the courses in the certificate program may count toward the B.S. in Computer Science.  There are several lower-division prerequisites for the courses in the program, so it will be difficult to complete except for majors in Computer Science or a related area.",
What CS offerings are available in software engineering?,The Computer Science department now offers an undergraduate software project course (CS 161) along with the longstanding undergraduate course in software engineering (CS 160) and the graduate software project course (CS 240).,
Are there internship or co-op programs for BSCS students?,"Yes.  The CS department has an internship program, and BSCS students are eligible for the math department's Center for Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (CAMCOS).  The SJSU Career Center also provides support for seeking and profiting from internship opportunities.",
What computing devices will I need as a Computer Science major?,"You will need a device with internet connectivity so that you can access the university's wireless network.  The network is available in every classroom.  For account or password information about the network, check the SJSUOne web site.",
Are there jobs available through the CS department?,"A very few jobs are available.  Check with the department office or see the question on financial assistance in the FAQ for the MS program. Keep in mind that this discussion refers to aid available through the department, rather than through the university.  Also, teaching associate positions are unlikely to be offered to undergraduates.",
Is there any software that is available at special rates to CS students?,"The CS Club web site often has links to such software, and to other resources as well.",http://csclubsjsu.com/
What is an advising hold?  What is a probation hold?  Why do I have one?    How can I get it removed?,"An advising hold is a mechanism by which students are prevented from registering for classes until they have seen an advisor.  For every semester's registration, advising holds are now placed on all Computer Science majors, graduate and undergraduate students alike. Probation holds are registration holds for students on academic probation.
To remove either kind of hold, see the advisor given by the instructions at the CS department web site.  It is important to remove advising holds before the end of each semester, since you cannot count on your advisor being on campus between semesters.",
May I count a newly created elective or deep course toward the BSCS? Must I follow a newly imposed prerequisite?,"The answer to the first question is yes, subject to any explicit restrictions placed on doing so.  That is, if you are following the BSCS requirements as of a certain date, it doesn't matter whether the course was an elective or a deep course was permitted on that date. For example, if you were already a CS major when CS 167B (DB2 Application Development for z/OS) became a deep course, and you are following the BSCS requirements that were in effect when you became a CS major, you can still use CS 167B as a deep course.  The same applies to CS 161 (Software Project), which was another late addition to the list of deep courses.  And the same applies to newly created elective courses such as CS 167A (DB2 Fundamentals for z/OS).",
Who should I see if I am having trouble with department or university rules and regulations?  Who should I see for other types of assistance?,"For most CS issues, you should start with the appropriate advisor, as given on the CS advising web page.",https://www.sjsu.edu/cs/practicalities/cs-advising/
How do I apply for graduation as a CS student?,"To apply for graduation, you must follow the steps below:
1. Register and attend a Computer Science Graduation Workshop.  At the workshop, you will be given a 'starter' major form listing the courses that you have completed and the courses that are in progress. 
2. On the major form, fill in the courses that you plan to take to fulfill the outstanding requirements. List the semester you intend to take each course.  Make sure you check the prerequisites and the the course offering patterns. 
3. Meet with your advisor so that they review your major form and approve it.
4. Submit the major form to the CS department office (MH 208) to get the department approval.
5. Once your major form is approved, you will get an email from the CS Undergraduate Coordinator with a copy of your approved major form attached.  Your major form will be sent electronically to the registrar.
6. Apply for graduation online via MySJSU.  Here's an Online Graduation Application tutorial.
7. After your application is processed by the registrar, you will receive a graduation worksheet via your preferred email address. PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW YOUR GRADUATION WORKSHEET and make sure you complete all GE and major courses listed.",http://www.sjsu.edu/registrar/graduation/index.php?utm_source=registrar&utm_medium=301&utm_campaign=redirect_registrar_graduation
What is a graduating senior? What is a graduation worksheet? What is a graduation checklist? Why are these important?,"By university policy, graduating seniors are to be given priority in registration for courses that they need to take in order to graduate on time. In particular, they are to be given priority over other students for adding courses. In recent semesters, the registrar's office has been providing special cards to graduating seniors that they may use to identify themselves to instructors.",
 I'm trying to fill out my major form.  What do I do on the form about courses I still need to take?,"You should include these courses on the form.  List the semester you intend to take them.
In the case of electives, you should make your best guess about which electives you will be taking, and when you will be taking them, and put these guesses on the form.
If you end up taking different courses than the ones you indicated on the form, you need to fill out a course substitution form reflecting the change.  If you are also changing your catalog rights, you need to fill out an appropriate form.  These forms are much simpler to fill out than the major form.",
"I've already turned in my major (or minor) form, but I will not be taking one or more of the courses listed on the form. What do I need to do?","This is a fairly common occurrence. Of course you will need to replace the courses you won't be taking with other courses, and the new set of courses still has to satisfy some set of major or minor requirements that you are entitled to use. A simple form called the Major/Minor Course Substitution Form is used to amend a major (or minor) form. You can download the form from the records office web site.  You don't need to see an advisor or the undergraduate coordinator.",
What are the requirements for graduation with honors?,"The requirements for graduation with honors are described in the department's section of the university catalog.   These are departmental honors, in the sense of the university catalog (follow the Undergraduate Information and Requirements | Honors links), as distinct from university honors at graduation (follow the same links).",
Is it difficult for CS majors to get a minor in another field? ,"With one exception, minors for CS majors require considerable extra coursework, since the BS program in CS has little or no room for free electives.  This exception is the minor in mathematics.  The math minor requires 18 units, including Calculus 1, Calculus 2, and 9 upper-division units in mathematics courses.",
Can I add a course after the deadline?,"You can add a course provided you meet the prerequisite requirements and the instructor signs your registration form. Complete a ""Late Enrollment"" form (PDF) in the Form Section and submit it to the College of Professional and Global Education (CPGE) office located at One Washington Square, Student Union - CPGE, San Jose CA 95192-0135 or fax to 408-924-2666 for the Associate Dean's approval.",
Can I drop my classes and receive a refund?,"Since classes offered through Academic Programs start on different dates during the semester, they do not follow the same refund calendar.
To calculate the refund percentage, please do the following:
- Drop the course officially before class starts, 100% refund
- Count the number of calendar days of your class (start to end, including weekends). This number of days is the class length.
- Calculate 10% of the class length. This is the deadline for a partial refund.
- From start date to deadline for a partial refund, students will get 75%.
- After this deadline, there will be no refund.",
How can I obtain a transcript?,"To order official transcripts, visit the Office of the Registrar.",http://newdev.sjsu.edu/registrar/academic_records/transcripts/index.php
How do I access my grades?,Grades become available within two to three weeks after the course is completed. Access your grades online via your one.SJSU (UserID and password required) account.,
How do I drop a course?,"Complete the drop process either by dropping the course online through your MySJSU account or filing a Petition to drop a course. All approval signatures/permissions are required. Leaving a course without authorization will result in a Withdrawl Unauthorized (WU) which is equivalent to an ""F"" grade",
Is financial aid available?,"Yes. San Jose State University offers limited financial aid, which may consist of Grant(s) and/or a Stafford Loan. There are a number of restrictions on these funds, which are outlined below. Refer to the Financial Aid office for additional information.",
Can you give me any tips for writing effective email queries?,"I get a lot of email, often from thoughtful people with good questions. I also follow several groups that I sponsor. Many of the email or group postings I receive are ineffective and unprofessional.",
